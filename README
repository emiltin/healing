Healing is a ruby library for configuring virtual servers.
Healind lets you specify the configuration of instances and volumes, and the software installed using ruby, and will then take care of launching the instances and installing and configuring them.


Currently Amazon EC2 is supported.




For more documentation, please look in the docs/ folder.



Enjoy!
